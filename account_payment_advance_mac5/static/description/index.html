            </p>
            <p class="oe_mt32">
                On the Apply Advance Payments window, specify the Application Journal, the default will be the configured Advance Payment Journal in settings.

                When applied on the invoice, payment will be shown below the invoice Total and in Advance Payments tab. TIP: You can unreconcile the payment by using the icon below the invoice Total but just make sure that the Advance Payment Journal is allowed on cancelling entries.
            </p>

                Application of advance payment on invoices will create a journal entry such that the accounts are based on the invoices account and advance payment account on payments. The amount (debit or credit) is the total of all advance payments applied.
